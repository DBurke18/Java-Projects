# Java Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains Java-based projects focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Java architectures. Each project demonstrates key principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more, along with practical use of databases and frameworks.

## Current Project: Class Scheduler

The first project in this repository is a **Class Scheduler**, built using **NetBeans IDE** and integrated with a relational database to manage student class registrations. The application allows users to:
- Add, remove, and update class schedules.
- Enroll students in available courses.
- Generate class schedules for individual students.

### Key Features:
- OOP principles: Implements encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for course, student, and schedule management.
- Database Integration: Utilizes JDBC to connect to a MySQL database, demonstrating CRUD operations for storing and retrieving class data.
- NetBeans IDE: Built using NetBeans, showcasing Java Swing for GUI and efficient project structuring.

## How to Run the Class Scheduler

### Requirements:
- NetBeans IDE (version 8 or higher)
- JDK 8 or higher
- MySQL for database management

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-projects.git
    ```
2. Open the project in NetBeans IDE.
3. Set up the MySQL database and import the provided SQL script to create the necessary tables.
4. Modify the database connection parameters in the source code.
5. Run the project from the NetBeans IDE.
